# Distributed-Scientific-Computing-for-Genomic-Data-Analysis

Overview

This project aims to build a distributed scientific computing system for genomic data analysis. It leverages open-source tools, cloud technologies, and advanced computational methods to handle and process large-scale genomic data efficiently.


System Architecture

Components:

## Data Ingestion: Tools for acquiring genomic data.

## Distributed Computing Cluster: Set up with Apache Spark for parallel data processing.

## Machine Learning: Implement models for genomic data analysis.

## Data Storage: Use Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for scalable storage.

## Web Application: Frontend for data visualization and user interaction.
